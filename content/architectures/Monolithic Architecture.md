# Summary

## TL;DR

Monolithic architectures are a more traditional approach towards application development, where the **entire** application is built as a single, indivisible unit. For a monolithic, all components of the application: being the business logic, user interfaces, data access layers, are tightly coupled and run in a single process.

**Key Characteristics**
1. **Single Codebase**: The entire application is developed using a single codebase, with a single stack for development.
2. **Single Deployment**: Changes to any part of the application will cause it to fail unless redeployed.
3. **Scalability**: Scalability is achievable, but when adding more resources to a monolithic application, readability and maintainability steadily decreases coupled with the fact that you would need to redeploy every time.

**Pros and Cons of Monolithic Architecture**

Companies have found some varying benefits from using monolithic architectures, but its dependent on many factors. One of the pros of using the monolithic architecture is its fast development speed; as there is only a singular codebase to work on, there is more considerations towards building a product that can ship rather than taking into account scalability, design flaws, or maintainability. Here are some potential cons: 

**Cons of Monolithic Architectures**
1. *Scalability Issues*
2. *Reliability Issues*
3. *Maintainability Issues*
4. Barrier to Technological Adoption
5. *Constant Redeployment*
6. *Bugs Hidden Within Deeper Implementations*
