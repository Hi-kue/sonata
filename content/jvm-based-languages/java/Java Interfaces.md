# Summary

## TL;DR

## What are Interfaces?

Interfaces are a crucial part of programming in Java, as it allows developers like us to write code that is flexible, scales, and provides overall more security. Often times, any professional developer would advise you to **program to interfaces, not implementation**. *Why would developers say this? What does it really mean?*

For the most part, the term emphasizes the importance of writing code that depends on abstract types (in this case, interfaces) rather than concrete classes in Java.
