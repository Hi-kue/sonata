# Abstract

### What is Go?

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language developed by Google, designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go aims to address concerns in other programming languages such as the following:
1. Slow compilation times;
2. Complex dependency management;
3. Challenges faced in concurrent programming.

The language features a clean and concise syntax, making it easy to pick-up, learn, and use. Go's powerful concurrency model, based on `goroutines` and channels, simplifies the development of concurrent applications. 

Additionally go also includes the following features:
- Extensive standard library;
- Static typing;
- Garbage collection;
- Robust and reliable environment for building:
	- Scalable systems;
	- Web servers / web applications;
	- Networking tools.

## Definitions

**goroutine**: lightweight execution thread in Go and a function that executes concurrently with the rest of the application.

**garbage collection**: also known as GC, is the process of recycling memory on behalf of the application by identifying which parts of memory are no longer needed.

**dependency management**: the process of managing all irrelated tasks and resources to ensure application completes successfully, on time, and on budget. 

**concurrency**: the fact of two or more events or circumstances happening or existing at the same time. 
	`[!!cite:computing term]` ability to execute more than one program or task simultaneously.

## TL;DR

Go, or Golang, is an open-source programming language from Google, created to tackle issues like slow compilation, complex dependency management, and concurrent programming challenges. It features an easy-to-learn syntax, an efficient concurrency model using goroutines and channels, and includes a comprehensive standard library, static typing, and garbage collection. Go is ideal for building scalable systems, web servers, and networking tools.
