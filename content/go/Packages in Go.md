> [!WARNING] Prerequisites for learning Go
> Documents related to go are following a series on Udemy by [Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) among some other prominent developers and course creators on LinkedIn Learning. To follow along with learning go, it is highly recommended to know the basics of another language.  

# Abstract

## Introduction to Packages in Go

Consider the following analogy, you are an amazon employee that is boxing items that a user has requested and bought. You would usually need a box and inside the box will be the contents--- which--- is basically a package. In go, packages are just a **grouping**/**collection** of units of code. 

### What are Packages in Go?

Every go program is organized and made up of a collection of packages.  By definition, a package is a collection of source files in the same directory with one another that are compiled together.  
### What are some Benefits in Using Packages?

Some benefits of using packages and modules in go are the following:
- **Code Organization**: 
	- Organized into logical units, which are easier to:
		- Understand;
		- Maintain;
		- and Collaborate on Projects.
- **Code Reuse**: Packages can be imported and used by other packages, promoting code reuse and avoiding duplication of effort.
- **Encapsulation**: Packages provide a way to control the visibility of code elements, ensuring that only the intended parts of the code are accessible from outside the package.
- **Namespace Management**: Packages help prevent naming conflicts by providing a unique namespace for each package.
- **Testability**: Packages can be easily tested in isolation, promoting a modular and testable codebase.

Some benefits of modules include, but are not limited to the following:
- **Dependency Management**: 
	- Modules provide a way to manage dependencies and versions.
	- Makes it easier to incorporate external code or libraries.
- **Reproducible Builds**: 
	- They ensure everyone is using the same versions of dependencies.
		- Leading to more consistent, and reproducible builds.
- **Versioning**: 
	- Modules can be versioned independently.
		- Allowing for easier upgrades and management.
- **Encapsulation**: 
	- Modules encapsulate code and dependencies.
		- making it easier to share and distribute code across different projects.
- **Ecosystem Integration**: 
	- Modules integrate with Go's tooling and ecosystem.
		- making it easier to discover, fetch, and use external packages and libraries.
## Definitions

**Package**: A container that contains various source files in the same directory that are compiled together.

**Import Path**: The unique string that identifies a package, typically following the structure: `domain/path/to/package`

**Exported/Un-exported Identifiers**: Identifiers (e.g., variables, functions, types) starting with an uppercase letter are exported and accessible from outside the package, while those starting with lowercase letter are un-exported and only accessible within the package itself. 

## TL;DR

Packages in Go are the fundamental units of code organization and modulization. They promote code reusability, encapsulation, and maintainability by grouping related code together and controlling their visibility. Packages can be imported and depend on other packages, which enable code sharing and dependency management. Understanding and effectively using packages is essential for writing scalable and maintainable Go programs.
