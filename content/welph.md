# Summary

This document is a curated list of beginner focused topics and concepts that every programming language has. As a programmer, learning the first programming language is always the hardest, but once you've learned one, the rest are just a matter of [noticing patterns and relations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1tuoMobTfQ). This document is a more shallow overlook at the following:

- `Syntax`: Syntax differences and similarities between programming languages.
- `General Data Types`: The primitive data types that are common across all languages.
- `Operators`: The common operators that are used accross all languages.
- `Control Flow`: The basic control flow statements that exist in all languages.
- `Arrays`: The basic arrays, lists, and collections that are common across all languages.
- `Strings`: How strings are handled in all languages, and the basic string operations that are common across all languages.
- `Functions and Methods`: What methods are, how they are defined, and how they are called in all languages.
- `Error Handling`: The basic error handling that is common across all languages.
- `Generics`: The basic generics that are common across all languages.
- `Lambda Expressions`: The basic lambda expressions that are common across all languages.
- `Extensions`: The basic extensions that are common across all languages.

More topics will be covered in subsequent documents but for more specific languages, such as Java having its own topics and C# having its own topics. Please consider this document as a reference for the basics of programming languages and the fundamentals that are common across all languages, ofc with some exceptions -- that's how I will take it.
