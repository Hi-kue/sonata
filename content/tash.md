# Abstract

When documenting a programming language, resource, or topic, it is best to adhere to specific conventions that ensure the following:
- Clarity within text;
- Consistency throughout documents;
- Readability throughout documents.

Documents that do not follow a set of conventions, will often times be difficult to understand from the vast audience--- which--- happens a lot more than usual. This document aims to address some of the conventions that will be used throughout every document for every programming language, topic, or resource.
